# TypeWriter

The main purpose of creating this program is for the purpose of me learning and testing JavaScript functionality as well as a basic refresher of working with HTML and CSS

# Instructions:
 - You have 30 seconds to type in the random series of word that appears on the screen, after completing, press enter to check whether everey character is correct. You cannot have any incorrect cases or extra spaces. The ENTIRE phrase will be considered incorrect if you do.
 - Once time is up, the program will submit whatever you have typed to see if it is correct
 
 # Notes on JavaScript:
 - The phrases that the user has to type is currently randomly generated by a word bank located in script.js
 - The phrase that is generated by the program ranges from 4 to 9 words all of which have the first letter captitalized
 
 # Potential Path for Future Developments:
- [ ] Flush out UI for program
- [ ] Alter to check word by word rather than phrase by phrase
- [ ] Add in a leaderboard system that stores the score made
- [ ] Add in difficulty levels where the user can opt out of having text case sensitive
- [ ] Link with wiki pages to generate a greater range of potential sentences
- [ ] Add functionality that allows for more than just "all or nothing" style of giving points
